# Badges

On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

# Visuals

Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

# Installation

Clone repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fernanhick/dash-react-pwa.git
```

Use Node.js install for dependency installation handling.

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support

Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.
